# Miranda
Miranda Robotic Rover - A Pi Zero Robotic System 

Miranda is a robotic rover whose mission is to roam autonomously and provide air quality and telemetry 
data wirelessly back to a central computing environment.A fleet of these low cost autonomous vehicles could be used to canvass an manufacturing plant or warehouse providing real time air quality data for that location.  Miranda is a variant of the ActoBitty rover kit (https://www.servocity.com/actobitty) that has been morphed from a two wheel drive system to a four wheel drive system.  The motor controller is a ZeroBorg from PiBorg (www.piborg.org) and uses a standard 9 volt rechargeable lithium battery.

# First Project - Sonar Coprocessor 
The first project is to build a sonar coprocessor using the ATTiny 85 Arduino chip.  The coprocessor will allow Miranda
to to maneuver autonomously.  The circuit diagram for the coprocessor is the following:
